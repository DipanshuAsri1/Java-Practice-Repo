 * The Phaser allows us to build logic in which threads need to wait on the barrier
 * before going to the next step of execution. ( It is similar to barrier).
 * We can coordinate multiple phases of execution, reusing a Phaser instance for each program phase.
 * Each phase can have a different number of threads waiting for advancing to another phase.
